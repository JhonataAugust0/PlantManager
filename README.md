It is impossible to observe the vibrant petals of the African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha)
without feeling the lull of color! According to NASA, it is scientific: the species causes a small
stimulus for the release of adrenaline in our body, which increases energy levels and
oxygenation, helping us to relax.

2. They are natural humidifiers:
Instead of buying a large, hard-to-camouflage home appliance, invest in
some American ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) around the house. Plants release moisture
perspiration and help make the environment more pleasant.

3. Some are natural remedies:
According to the National Institutes of Health, aloe vera was known as the ‚Äúplant of the
immortality ‚Äùin ancient Egypt and used to heal wounds. Nowadays, we usually use it to
treat sunburn and it is an active ingredient in several beauty treatments.

from Costa Farms, Justin Hancock, colorful leaves bring inspiration and energize what's around you.

that purify the air, according to NASA.

this has concentrations of formaldehyde.

7. Your colors soothe your eyes:
Among the decorative benefits of plants is, according to Good Housekeeping, the relief of tired eyes.
Watching the green leaves after hours of working in front of a computer can be a good idea, as the shade
is perceived by the brain as smooth.

8. They help with concentration:
A study by the Royal College of Agriculture found that students paid 70% more attention when in an environment
with plants. If your house doesn't have a lot of light, bet on some varieties that do well indoors.
When in doubt, choose bamboo - it also helps with energies related to Feng Shui.

9. They are decorative:
Plants are one of the essential elements of really stylish homes. In addition to the undeniable natural qualities,
they can also be used for their colors, complementing the decor.

10. Stress goes away:
Are you pulling your hair out at work? A potted plant on the table can help you take a deep breath and calm down.
A report by the Journal of Environmental Psychology points out that flowers like Anthurium help to lower stress levels.
